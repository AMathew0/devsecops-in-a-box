# 🔐 Security Policy – DevSecOps-In-A-Box

## 📌 Overview

This project follows **DevSecOps best practices** by integrating security into every phase of the development lifecycle — from coding and containerization to CI/CD and Kubernetes deployment.

---

## ✅ Security Practices We Follow

### 1. 🧹 **Secure Coding Standards**
- Backend (Flask):
  - Input validation & output encoding
  - Rate limiting & CSRF protection
  - Secure JWT implementation (short expiry, signing key rotation)
  - Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- Frontend (React):
  - Avoid direct API secrets in code
  - CORS configured securely
  - No inline JavaScript or dangerous eval usage

---

### 2. 🐳 **Container Security**
- Use **official base images** (Alpine, Python-slim)
- Scan images with **Trivy** in CI/CD
- Minimize image layers and installed packages
- Avoid running containers as `root`
- Regularly update and rebuild images

---

### 3. ☸️ **Kubernetes Security**
- Namespaces used to isolate app (`simple-note`)
- NetworkPolicies (to be added) to restrict traffic
- PodSecurityContext:
  - RunAsNonRoot: true
  - ReadOnlyRootFilesystem: true
- Secrets managed using K8s `Secret` objects (base64 encoded)

---

### 4. 🔁 **CI/CD Pipeline Security**
- CI/CD via **GitHub Actions**
  - Secrets encrypted and stored in GitHub Secrets
  - Jobs run in isolated environments
  - Code linting and security scans before deploy
- Optional: Jenkins in hardened Docker container

---

### 5. 🔍 **Security Testing Tools Integrated**
| Tool        | Purpose                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Trivy**   | Scan Docker images (CI phase)  |
| **OWASP ZAP** | DAST: Scan live Flask app     |
| **Falco**   | K8s runtime anomaly detection  |
| **Auditd**  | Linux system auditing          |

---

### 6. 📈 **Monitoring & Alerting**
- Metrics collected via **Prometheus**
- Visualized via **Grafana**
- Alerts can be integrated with webhooks, email, or Slack

---

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements
- Integrate **SBOM generation** (e.g., Syft)
- Apply **OPA/Gatekeeper** for policy enforcement
- Implement **SSO/OAuth2** for user access
- Add **SAST** tooling (e.g., Bandit for Python)

---

## 🗣️ Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a vulnerability or potential security concern:

1. Please **do not open a public issue**
2. Instead, report it privately by emailing:  
   📧 **amathai.edu@outlook.com**
3. You will receive acknowledgment within 48 hours
