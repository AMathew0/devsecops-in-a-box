# 🧰 DevSecOps-In-A-Box

*A Lightweight, Containerized, Hands-on Learning Platform for Full Stack DevSecOps.*

---

## 🌟 Project Goal

To build a **portable Linux VM** that simulates the **full DevSecOps lifecycle** — from app development to CI/CD, security scanning, Kubernetes deployment, and monitoring.

Ideal for IT professionals, students, and cloud/security learners looking to get practical, end-to-end experience.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

### 🔧 Base VM Setup

- OS: **Lubuntu** (desktop or server mode)
- Network: **VirtualBox Host-Only + NAT**
- Tools: Docker, Docker Compose, Minikube/K3s, Git, VS Code (optional)

### 🐳 Containerized App Stack

| Tier     | Container   | Description                    |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| Frontend | React       | Simple note-taking UI          |
| Backend  | Python Flask| REST API (CRUD + Auth)         |
| Database | PostgreSQL  | Encrypted notes storage        |
| Tools    | Trivy, ZAP  | Security testing containers    |

➡️ Managed using `docker-compose` in local development.

### ☸️ Kubernetes (Minikube/K3s)

| Component   | Description                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `frontend`  | React app + Service + Deployment     |
| `backend`   | Flask API + Service + Deployment     |
| `database`  | StatefulSet or Pod with PVC          |
| `tools`     | Falco, Prometheus, Grafana pods      |

➡️ Namespace: `simple-note`

---

### 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

- GitHub Actions: Lint, Test, Build, Push Images, Deploy via `kubectl`
- Optional: Jenkins in Docker or Pod
